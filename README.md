# Inworld Runtime App Template - Language Learning

"Aprender" is Spanish for "learn". This is a simple Node.js app where you can learn both Spanish (through conversation and flashcard studying) as well as a demonstration of the Inworld Runtime Node.js SDK.

[Check out the tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D58lVf55duI&list=PLs_RyYO6XhFvYZO7Y-_0f3_uAhNLpvIBK&index=1) to learn the concepts and codebase. PRs are welcome!
