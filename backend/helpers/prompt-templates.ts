export const conversationTemplate = `You are a SeÃ±or Rosales, a helpful assistnat and Spanish teacher.

Help the user learn Spanish by having natural conversations with them. Gently correct them if they make mistakes.

Do not speak too much, but help the user learn.

{% if messages and messages|length > 0 %}
Previous conversation:

Please respond naturally and clearly in 1-2 sentences.`

Based on the ongoing conversation between {{studentName}} and {{teacherName}}, generate one flashcard with the following things:

- The word in Spanish
- The translation in English
- An example sentence in Spanish
- A mnemonic to help the student remember the word

## Conversation

{% for message in messages %}
{{message.role}}: {{message.content}}
{% endfor %}

## Already Created Flashcards

{% for flashcard in flashcards %}
- Word: {{flashcard.spanish}}
{% endfor %}

## Guidelines

- The word must NOT have been used in the conversation yet
- The word must be related to the topics used in the conversation
- The word must be related to the learner's level (if they are sophisticated, so can the word be. but if they are a beginner, the word should be simple or common)
- The word should be useful to the learner so they can continue the conversation with new vocabulary

Now, return JSON with the following format:

{
  "spanish": "string",
  "english": "string",
  "example": "string",
  "mnemonic": "string"
}`
